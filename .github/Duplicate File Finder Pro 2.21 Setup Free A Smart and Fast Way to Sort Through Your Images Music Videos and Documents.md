- Select duplicates in folder. This feature allows you to choose where to keep or remove duplicates. You can specify a priority folder where all duplicates will be kept, and select other folders where duplicates will be removed.
- Restore removed duplicates. If you accidentally delete some duplicates that you want to keep, you can use Duplicate File Finder Pro to restore them from the Trash. You can also undo the last removal action if you change your mind.
