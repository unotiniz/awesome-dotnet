## Step 3: Edit the config files
 
Some players may experience crashes, low FPS, or other issues when running Need for Speed Shift on a 64-bit Windows 10 PC. To fix these problems, you need to edit some config files in the game folder. You can use any text editor, such as Notepad or Sublime Text, to open and modify these files.
 
The first file you need to edit is graphicsconfig.xml, which is located in Documents\NFS SHIFT folder. This file controls the graphics settings of the game. You can tweak these settings according to your preference and hardware specifications. For example, you can change the resolution, anti-aliasing, texture quality, etc. You can also disable motion blur and depth of field effects if they cause performance issues or nausea.
 
The second file you need to edit is shift.exe.config, which is located in the main game folder where you installed Need for Speed Shift. This file controls the compatibility mode of the game executable. You need to change the value of <supportedruntime version="v2.0.50727"></supportedruntime> to <supportedruntime version="v4.0"></supportedruntime>. This will make the game run on .NET Framework 4 instead of .NET Framework 2, which may improve stability and compatibility with Windows 10.
