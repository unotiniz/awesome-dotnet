Computational Structural Mechanics by Rajasekaran and Sankarasubramanian is a comprehensive and rigorous book that covers the theory and practice of structural analysis using matrix methods. The book explains the fundamental concepts and principles of structures, such as equilibrium, compatibility, virtual work, energy methods, and stiffness and flexibility matrices. The book also demonstrates the development of well-structured computer programs for the analysis of structures by the matrix methods.
 
The book is divided into 12 chapters, each with a clear introduction, objectives, summary, review questions, and solved examples. The chapters are as follows:

1. Introduction: This chapter introduces the scope and objectives of the book, the historical development of structural analysis, the classification of structures, and the basic assumptions and idealizations.
2. Degree of Kinematic Indeterminacy: This chapter defines the degree of kinematic indeterminacy of structures, such as trusses, beams, frames, arches, cables, and grids. It also discusses the methods of calculating the degree of kinematic indeterminacy using joint displacements and member forces.
3. Degree of Static Indeterminacy: This chapter defines the degree of static indeterminacy of structures, such as trusses, beams, frames, arches, cables, and grids. It also discusses the methods of calculating the degree of static indeterminacy using equilibrium equations and compatibility conditions.
4. Fundamental Concepts of Structures: This chapter reviews the fundamental concepts of structures, such as axial force, shear force, bending moment, torsion, stress, strain, deformation, elastic constants, and constitutive relations. It also introduces the concepts of influence lines and moving loads.
5. Energy Concepts in Structural Analysis: This chapter introduces the energy concepts in structural analysis, such as strain energy, complementary energy, potential energy, virtual work principle, Castigliano's theorem, Betti's theorem, Maxwell's theorem, and reciprocal theorem. It also applies these concepts to analyze determinate and indeterminate structures.
6. Relationship Between Element and System: This chapter establishes the relationship between element and system in structural analysis. It explains how to derive the element stiffness matrix and element stress resultants from the element flexibility matrix and element end displacements. It also explains how to assemble the system stiffness matrix and system stress resultants from the element stiffness matrix and element stress resultants.
7. Equations of Statics and Kinematics: This chapter derives the equations of statics and kinematics for structural analysis. It shows how to obtain the system equilibrium equations from the system stiffness matrix and system end displacements. It also shows how to obtain the system compatibility equations from the system flexibility matrix and system end forces.
8. Flexibility Method: This chapter explains the flexibility method of structural analysis. It shows how to use the system compatibility equations to solve for the system end forces and then use them to calculate the internal forces and displacements of structures. It also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the flexibility method.
9. Stiffness Approach: This chapter explains the stiffness approach of structural analysis. It shows how to use the system equilibrium equations to solve for the system end displacements and then use them to calculate the internal forces and displacements of structures. It also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the stiffness approach.
10. Direct Stiffness Method: This chapter explains the direct stiffness method of structural analysis. It shows how to use the element stiffness matrix and element end displacements to calculate the element stress resultants and then use them to assemble the system stiffness matrix and system stress resultants. It also shows how to use the system stiffness matrix and system external loads to solve for the system end displacements and then use them to calculate the internal forces and displacements of structures. It also discusses how to handle various types of boundary conditions using transformation matrices.
11. Special Topics: This chapter covers some special topics in structural analysis using matrix methods. It discusses how to use substructuring techniques to divide a complex structure into simpler substructures and analyze them separately. It also discusses how to use finite element method to discretize a continuous structure into finite elements and analyze them using matrix methods. It also discusses how to analyze space frames using matrix methods.
