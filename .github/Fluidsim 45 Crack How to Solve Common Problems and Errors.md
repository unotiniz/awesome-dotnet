# FluidSIM: A Powerful Simulation Software for Pneumatics, Hydraulics and Electrical Engineering
 
FluidSIM is a comprehensive software for creating, simulating, teaching and learning about electropneumatic, electrohydraulic, digital and electronic circuits. The different program functions interact seamlessly and link different sources of media and knowledge. FluidSIM combines an intuitive circuit diagram editor with detailed descriptions of all components, component photos, cross-sectional animations and video sequences. The simulation software is ideal for preparing lessons, for use in classrooms and for independent learning.
 
FluidSIM has been the world's leading circuit diagram, design and simulation program for pneumatics, hydraulics and electrical engineering for more than 25 years. Version 6 sets a new benchmark for individuality and convenience for both teachers and students. FluidSIM has already received several awards, including the Expert System Innovation Award, the Worlddidac Award and the German Education Software Award. With more than 300,000 installations worldwide since 1995, FluidSIM is one of the most successful software packages in mechatronics training.

FluidSIM enables the interactive simulation of circuits created by users themselves. Not only is it possible to calculate status changes and switching operations, but users can also actively intervene and operate switches or switch valves and directly identify the resulting effects. FluidSIM reacts immediately to changes made to the systems and simulates the new conditions. There is also an option to transmit and check signals from other programs via connected hardware or via interfaces. In addition to the real measuring devices that are built into the circuit, FluidSIM also offers virtual measuring devices that display all status variables at any connection at any time.
 
FluidSIM has a wide range of pneumatic, hydraulic, electrotechnical, electronic and digital components that are contained in libraries. These are divided into the three areas of pneumatics, hydraulics and electrical engineering and are available separately or together in FluidSIM. GRAFCET simulation components are also included in all packages.

Thanks to a new type of diagnostics concept, FluidSIM stores error models for various components that depict typical defects. Component errors are combined into error configurations using the dialogue provided for this purpose. These error configurations can be protected with a password so students do not have access to the defective components. During the simulation, the virtual measuring devices are used to identify the defective components, which are repaired immediately if necessary. Depending on the level of knowledge of the user, the success of the repair can be displayed.
